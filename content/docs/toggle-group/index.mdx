### When To Use

Use the Toggle Group component when you need to:

- Allow users to select a single option or multiple options from a group
- Create segmented controls or button groups for selecting options
- Implement toolbar-like controls for formatting or view modes
- Provide a group of related toggle options that should be visually connected
- Create radio button alternatives with a more button-like appearance

Toggle Groups are particularly useful for presenting a set of related choices where the user needs to see all options at once.
