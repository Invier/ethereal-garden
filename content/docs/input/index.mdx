### When To Use

Use the Input component when you need to:

- Collect single-line text input from users
- Create form fields for names, emails, passwords, and other text data
- Implement search fields, number inputs, or date pickers
- Allow users to enter specific information in a structured format
- Create fields that may need validation or formatting

Input fields are essential building blocks for forms and interactive user interfaces.
