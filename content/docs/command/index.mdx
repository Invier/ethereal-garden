### When To Use

Use the Command component when you want to provide a keyboard-centric interface for quick navigation and actions. It's especially useful for:

- Global application search
- Keyboard shortcut menus (like VS Code's command palette)
- Quick navigation between different parts of your application
- Executing commands without using the mouse
- Creating a power-user interface for advanced users

The Command component improves productivity by allowing users to quickly find and execute actions using keyboard shortcuts.
