## Props

  export type LabelProps = Omit<LabelProps, keyof React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLLabelElement>>`}
  name="LabelProps"
/>

## Accessibility

The Label component follows the WAI-ARIA label pattern for accessibility:

- Uses the native HTML `<label>` element, ensuring proper association with form controls
- Supports the `htmlFor` attribute to explicitly associate labels with inputs via their IDs
- Maintains proper focus states when labels are clicked
- Includes appropriate styling for disabled states
- Ensures sufficient color contrast for readability

When using the Label component:

- Always associate labels with their corresponding form controls
- Consider using the `required` attribute and visual indicators for required fields
- Maintain clear, concise text that describes the purpose of the form control
