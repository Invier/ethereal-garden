### When To Use

Use cards to group related content and actions. They provide a flexible and extensible container for displaying information. Cards are useful for:

- Displaying related information in a cohesive unit
- Organizing content in grids or lists
- Showcasing products, articles, or services
- Creating dashboards with multiple data points
- Building responsive layouts

Cards help create a clear visual hierarchy and improve the organization of your interface.
