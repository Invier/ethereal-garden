### When To Use

Use the Scroll Area component when you need to:

- Create a scrollable container with a custom scrollbar
- Ensure consistent scrollbar styling across different browsers
- Control the appearance and behavior of scrollbars
- Maintain a uniform UI design regardless of the user's operating system
- Create scrollable areas with limited height or width

Scroll Areas are especially useful for creating contained scrollable sections within a page, such as side panels, code blocks, long lists, and modal content.

### Examples
<Preview
  lang="jsx"
  file="/scroll-area/__demo__/basic"
  title="Basic"
/>

<Preview
  lang="jsx"
  file="/scroll-area/__demo__/horizontal"
  title="Horizontal"
/>

<Preview
  lang="jsx"
  file="/scroll-area/__demo__/with-max-height"
  title="With Max Height"
/>

<Preview
  lang="jsx"
  file="/scroll-area/__demo__/custom"
  title="Custom"
/>

### Props
<AutoTypeTable path="./components/ui/scroll-area.tsx" name="ScrollArea" />
<AutoTypeTable path="./components/ui/scroll-area.tsx" name="ScrollBar" />
