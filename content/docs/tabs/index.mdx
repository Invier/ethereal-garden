### When To Use

Use the Tabs component when you need to:

- Organize related content into separate views where only one view is visible at a time
- Allow users to switch between different sections without navigating to a new page
- Save space by showing only the relevant content for the selected tab
- Group content by category or function
- Create a workflow where users need to focus on one section at a time

Tabs are especially useful for forms, settings pages, dashboards, and any interface where multiple related sections of content need to be organized.
