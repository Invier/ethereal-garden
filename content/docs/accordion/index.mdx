### When To Use

Use accordions to vertically stack sections of content that can be expanded or collapsed to reveal more information. They're useful for:

- Organizing content into logical sections
- Conserving vertical space by hiding content until needed
- Creating FAQ sections
- Simplifying complex forms or interfaces

<Preview
  lang="jsx"
  file="/accordion/__demo__/basic"
  title="Basic"
/>

<Preview
  lang="jsx"
  file="/accordion/__demo__/custom-styling"
