### When To Use

Use the Textarea component when you need to allow users to:

- Enter multiple lines of text
- Write descriptions, comments, or longer-form content
- Input larger amounts of information than would fit in a standard text field
- Provide feedback, notes, or detailed explanations
- Compose messages or posts

Textareas are perfect for scenarios where users need space to express themselves with more than a few words.

### Examples

  lang="jsx"
