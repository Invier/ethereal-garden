### When To Use

Use the Pagination component when you need to:

- Navigate through large sets of data split across multiple pages
- Allow users to browse content that is divided into pages
- Implement search results pages with multiple results
- Create tables or lists with many items
- Display a sequence of steps or pages
- Build interfaces for catalogs, galleries, or any paginated content

Pagination helps users navigate through content without overwhelming them with too much information at once.
