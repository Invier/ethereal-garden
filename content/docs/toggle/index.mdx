### When To Use

Use the Toggle component when you need to:

- Create a button that has two distinct states (on/off)
- Allow users to toggle a single option on or off
- Implement toolbar buttons that can be activated or deactivated
- Create buttons for formatting options (like bold, italic in text editors)
- Implement filter or view options that can be toggled

The Toggle component is ideal for binary state controls that need to be visually distinct from checkboxes or switches.
