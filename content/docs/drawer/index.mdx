### When To Use

Use the Drawer component when you need to:

- Provide quick access to content or actions without leaving the current page
- Display additional information or forms in a side panel
- Create a menu that slides in from the edge of the screen
- Implement a mobile navigation pattern
- Show contextual information related to the current view

Drawers are particularly useful for mobile interfaces or when you need to preserve context while accessing additional functionality.
