### When To Use

Use the Slider component when you need to:

- Allow users to select a value or range from a continuous set of values
- Provide control for adjusting settings that have a minimum and maximum value
- Create interfaces for audio volume, brightness, or opacity controls
- Allow users to set a range within defined boundaries
- Create visual controls for numeric inputs with a finite range

Sliders are useful when the precise value is not as important as the relative position within the allowed range.
