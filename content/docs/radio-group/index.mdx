## Accessibility

The Radio Group component adheres to the [WAI-ARIA Radio Group Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radiobutton/).

- The RadioGroup uses `role="radiogroup"` and each RadioGroupItem has `role="radio"`.
- When a RadioGroupItem is checked, `aria-checked` is set to `true`.
- Radio items are properly labeled using either `aria-label` or associated form labels.
- Keyboard users can navigate between options using arrow keys and select options with Space.
- Focus management follows logical tab order and highlights the active option.
