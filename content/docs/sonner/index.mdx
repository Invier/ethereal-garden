title: Sonner
description: A toast notification component that provides unobtrusive feedback.

### When To Use

Use the Sonner component when you need to:

- Display non-blocking notifications or feedback to users
- Show success, error, or information messages
- Notify users of system events or status changes
- Present time-sensitive information that doesn't require user action
- Provide feedback after user actions (form submissions, save operations, etc.)

Sonner notifications are temporary and disappear automatically, making them ideal for transient feedback that doesn't interrupt the user's workflow.
