## When To Use

- When you need to display images, videos, or other media with a consistent aspect ratio
- To prevent layout shifts as content loads
- To create responsive UI elements that maintain their proportions across different screen sizes
- When implementing image galleries or media carousels

## Examples

### Basic

<Preview lang="jsx" file="/aspect-ratio/__demo__/basic" />

The basic implementation maintains a 16/9 aspect ratio for an image.

### With Different Ratios

<Preview lang="jsx" file="/aspect-ratio/__demo__/ratios" />

You can customize the aspect ratio to suit different types of content.

### For Video Content

<Preview lang="jsx" file="/aspect-ratio/__demo__/video" />

Aspect ratios can be applied to video elements to maintain consistent sizing.

## Accessibility

The Aspect Ratio component is a visual utility and doesn't introduce any specific accessibility considerations.

However, for optimal accessibility:

- Ensure that images within the Aspect Ratio container have appropriate `alt` text
- For videos, provide captions and transcripts when needed
- Maintain sufficient color contrast for any text overlaid on media within the container

<AutoTypeTable
  type={`import { AspectRatioProps } from "@radix-ui/react-aspect-ratio"
