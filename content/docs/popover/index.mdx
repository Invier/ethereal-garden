The Popover component adheres to the [WAI-ARIA Dialog Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal/).

- The popover trigger has `aria-expanded` set to `true` or `false` depending on the popover state.
- When open, the popover content has `aria-modal` set to `true`.
- Focus is trapped within the popover when open for keyboard users.
- Escape key dismisses the popover.
- The popover has a close button for accessibility.
- ARIA roles, states, and properties are appropriately applied to ensure screen reader compatibility.
