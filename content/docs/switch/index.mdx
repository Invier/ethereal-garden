### When To Use

Use the Switch component when you need to:

- Allow users to toggle a single option on or off
- Provide a binary choice with immediate effect
- Create an on/off control for settings or features
- Enable or disable a functionality
- Create a visual toggle that clearly shows the current state

Switches are ideal for settings pages, feature toggles, and anywhere you need to show a clear binary state with immediate visual feedback.
