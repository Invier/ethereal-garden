### When To Use

Use the Progress component when you need to:

- Show the progress of a task or operation
- Indicate loading state with determinate progress
- Visualize the completion percentage of a multi-step process
- Provide visual feedback for file uploads, form submissions, or data processing
- Display progress toward a goal or target

Progress indicators help users understand how much of a task has been completed and how much remains.
