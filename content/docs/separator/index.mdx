### When To Use

Use the Separator component when you need to:

- Create a visual divider between sections of content
- Separate items in a list or menu
- Establish visual hierarchy and organization
- Divide groups of related items
- Create subtle visual breaks in dense interfaces

Separators improve the readability and scanability of content by visually grouping and segmenting related elements.

### Examples
<Preview
  lang="jsx"
  file="/separator/__demo__/basic"
  title="Basic"
/>

<Preview
  lang="jsx"
  file="/separator/__demo__/orientation"
  title="Orientation"
/>

<Preview
  lang="jsx"
  file="/separator/__demo__/with-text"
  title="With Text"
/>

<Preview
  lang="jsx"
  file="/separator/__demo__/custom"
  title="Custom"
/>

### Props
<AutoTypeTable path="./components/ui/separator.tsx" name="Separator" />

### Accessibility

The Separator component follows accessibility best practices:

- Properly uses the `role="separator"` attribute when not decorative
- Can be set as `decorative={false}` when it's semantically meaningful
- Maintains proper color contrast for better visibility
- Works with screen readers to indicate sections of content
- Can be visually styled while maintaining accessibility
