## Accessibility

The Sheet component follows WAI-ARIA guidelines for dialog components:

- Uses `role="dialog"` for the sheet
- Supports keyboard navigation for opening, closing, and interacting with the sheet
- When opened, focus is trapped within the sheet until it is closed
- The `Escape` key closes the sheet
- Uses aria-labelledby and aria-describedby to provide context for screen readers
