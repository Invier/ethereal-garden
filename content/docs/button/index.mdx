### When To Use

Use the Button component when you need to:

- Trigger an action or submit a form

Buttons are fundamental interactive elements that allow users to take actions and make choices with a single tap or click.

### Accessibility

The Button component adheres to the following accessibility best practices:

- Uses native `<button>` elements which are accessible by default
- Maintains proper focus states for keyboard navigation
- Supports keyboard activation (Enter and Space)
- Provides appropriate ARIA attributes
- Disabled states are properly communicated to assistive technologies
- Focus is visible for keyboard users through focus ring styling
- Loading states prevent multiple submissions and provide visual feedback
